# How to contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to any OpenSQZ project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement(CLA). This is necessary because you own the copyright to your changes, even
after your contribution becomes part of this project. So this agreement simply
gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the
project. 

You're required to sign the CLA the first time you create a pull request, 
and you generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project in OpenSQZ organziation), 
you probably don't need to do it again.

## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult [GitHub Help] for more
information on using pull requests.

Small PRs are easy to review, and large PRs are difficult to review.
